Rp3 (Ribosome Profiling and Proteogenomics pipeline) was developed to integrate the analyses for three different multi-omics techniques: RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq and Proteogenomics. Its overarching goal is to identify novel microproteins (shorter than 100/150 aa) encoded by small Open Reading Frames (smORFs). Then, it will check for translational evidence in the Ribo-Seq data for these novel smORFs.
